# Day 1, Part 2

Part 2 asks for adding every element in the ordered set with its
following 3 successive elements to calculate the moving average.

Load the data as before,

```forth
2000 cell array data
s" 1.txt" 0 data array-load
```

Define `sweep-three` that will take the adress of an element, and sum
the three elements that follows,

```forth
: sweep-three ( addr -- addr n )
  0  3 0 do  over i cells + @ + loop ;
```

Define `collect` to run `sweep-three` and store the result in
memory.

```forth
: collect ( addr -- addr ) sweep-three , ;
```

Finally, define `sweep`, and collect all the data into memory and
leave the starting address on stack,

```forth
: sweep            ( -- ) ['] collect 0 data 2000 for-each ;
: sweep       ( -- addr ) mark sweep count! ;
```

The gobbledygook words `mark` and `count!` stores the count as the
first element in memory, and leaves the starting element's address on
stack.

The rest of the solution is the same as Part 1, as we created a new
array that is an ordered set of `sweep-three` results. We include the
Part 1 code as is,

```forth
: depth< ( addr -- addr f ) dup cell - @   over @  < ;

: collect ( addr acc -- addr acc )
  swap depth< if 1 else 0 then rot + ;

: solve ( addr -- n )
  ['] collect swap dup cell - @ 2 - 0 reduce ;
```

Execute the Part 1 solution on the result of `sweep`.

```forth
: day1-part2   sweep solve ;
```

Run and assert the result.
```forth
day1-part2 1589 assert
```
