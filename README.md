# Advent of Code 2021

## What is Advent of Code?

> [Advent of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code) is an
> annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that
> follow an Advent calendar

## What is this code repository for?

This repository is an excuse to write Forth code by solving Advent of
Code 2021 problems.

All the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files,
including this README.md, are valid
[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))
source code thanks to Forth allowing to define new syntax. Anything
outside [fenced code
blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)
will be skipped by the Forth compiler/interpreter. This allows code to
be written in the [literate
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
style.

## How to run?

Running this file with the Forth compiler/interpreter will run each
day of the advent of code problems.

It is tested with [gforth](https://www.gforth.org) 0.7.9, and can be run
as:

```
gforth README.md
```
