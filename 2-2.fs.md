# Day 2, Part 2

Part 2 introduces only an `aim` variable, and slight differences in
how each command is interpreted.

Add the new variable `aim`:

```forth
variable position   variable depth   variable aim
```

Define a `parse-number` to factor out repeating code.

```forth
: parse-number parse-name evaluate ;
```

It only parses the next number from the input stream.


Define the commands, this time with the addition of `aim`.

```forth
: forward ( n -- ) parse-number dup position +! aim @ * depth +! ;
: down    ( n -- ) parse-number aim +! ;
: up      ( n -- ) parse-number aim @ swap - aim ! ;
```

And finally, like in Part 1, include the input file, and print the
result, then exit.

```forth
: day2-part2 s" 2.txt" included position @ depth @ * ;

day2-part2 1842742223 assert
```
