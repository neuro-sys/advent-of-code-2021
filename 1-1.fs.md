thanks to Forth allowing us to define new syntax.

# Day 1 Part 1

We are given an ordered set of numbers, and asked to count the number
of times when the two successive ones are ordered such that the
previous one is smaller than the next.

First, load the data into an array in memory with zero as a terminator.

```forth

s" 1.txt"  load-data data
```

Note that `load-data` is defined in `lib.fs`. `lib.fs` is a file where
I keep a collection of useful words that are not directly related to
the problem, and generic enough to be used across most problems.

`load-data` is defined is like this:

```forth
: depth<   dup cell - @   over @  < ;
: collect  swap depth< if 1 else 0 then rot + ;
: solve    ['] collect data cell + 0 reduce ;

solve .

bye
```
